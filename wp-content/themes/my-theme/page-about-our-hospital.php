                <h3>"More frequent fertility treatment"</h3>
                <p>This word contains the desire to make it possible for patients, doctors, and staff to communicate and become good, and to perform fertility treatment that tends to be dark.
                 About forty staff members will do their best to support as many patients as possible to have children.</p>

                <p>We offer one minute on foot from the 35th exit of Ikebukuro, from 8am to 8pm on weekdays (Monday, Wednesdays, Fridays), and Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. We want to
                     continue to be a clinic that is easy for patients to visit. Therefore, we regularly conduct patient questionnaires and incorporate opinions.
                        In order to prioritize work and life work based on the opinions of many patients, we have established a system that finishes medical treatment and accounting at nine 
                        o'clock if you visit the hospital at 8am on weekdays so that you can prioritize your work and life work. In addition, if you want to leave the hospital earlier than nine o'clock,
                        please return immediately after blood collection and in-house examination, and we have prepared a system as much as possible to confirm the result / treatment policy by phone on 
                        the same day, or check the result / treatment policy on the way home from work at night.
                        It is necessary to come to the egg collection day and the transplant date at the specified time, so we have incorporated opinions from the patient questionnaire so that you do not 
                        have to take a break from work as much as possible. In addition, if samples are prepared from 8am to 7pm, artificial insemination, semen testing, and sperm freezing are also available until 8pm.</p>

                <p>If multiple doctors provide medical care for each patient, there is a possibility that
                     there will be a difference in the treatment policy and explanation by the doctor, but
                      our hospital is conducting the decision of the treatment policy, examination, and surgery
                       by the director alone, so there is no disagreement by the doctor. It is an environment where
                     it is easy to listen to the opinions and wishes of patients and to communicate.</p>
